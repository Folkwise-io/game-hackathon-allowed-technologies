# Mintbean Game Hackathons - Allowed Technologies

Not every technology is a good fit for Mintbean game hackathons. This list contains technologies that can / cannot be used in a game hackathon at Mintbean. Generally speaking, because Mintbean is about coding, we disallow anything that has a WYSIWYG editor, or other such elements that could give a developer a massive leg up over their competition.

Unless specified, this list applies to every single game hackathon.
